# camelot_communicator
 
Camelot communicator is part of the PhD thesis of [Giulio Mori](https://github.com/liogiu2) that has the objective of making an evaluation tool for Experience Managers. 
The aim of this library is to give a structure to [Camelot](http://cs.uky.edu/~sgware/projects/camelot/) where AIs can reason on without implementing all the camelot commands hard coded in the code. It uses [PDDL](https://planning.wiki/) as language to build a state of the word and as a medium to move informations of what is changing on the environment.
