to have the PDDL executer working we need to install http://www.fast-downward.org/Releases/20.06
During the installation we have to make sure to have installed Visual Studio with CMake. Execute the build.py from the visual studio console. Before executing make sure that the builds/release/CMakeCache has all the paths setted up correctly.
